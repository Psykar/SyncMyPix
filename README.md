SyncMyPix
=========

With SyncMyPix, you can get your Android based phone in sync with all of your friends.
Currently only Facebook is supported.

SyncMyPix AL
------------

My (Andrew67) fork of SyncMyPix.

Work so far includes:
- Slight rebranding
- Activities now use Holo Dark theme and ActionBar (on Android >= 3.0)
- Backend code tweaks (see commit logs)

Future work:
- Better Facebook API integration
- Smarter name matching (modularized for easier support of different cultures)

Features
--------

- Sync your phone's contacts with your Facebook friends' profile pictures
- Option for only syncing contacts with phone numbers
- Option for 'Smart name matching'  
- Sync runs in the background leaving you free to do other tasks by pressing HOME
- View the results of the last sync operation 
- Manual conflict resolution in the "Results" screen where a long press on a friend allows the picture to be manually added to a contact
